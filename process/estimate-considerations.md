Estimating work as a developer - key factors to consider:

Scope: Understand the full scope of the project and what is required to complete it. Break the project down into smaller, manageable tasks and estimate the time required for each.

Complexity: Consider the complexity of each task. A task that is more complex will likely take longer to complete than a simple task.

Dependencies: Identify any tasks that are dependent on other tasks, and factor in additional time for these dependencies.

Risks: Identify any potential risks that could impact the project and factor in additional time to address these risks.

Experience: Use your past experience to inform your estimates. If you have completed similar tasks in the past, use that experience to inform your estimates.

Team Size and Skill: Consider the size and skill of your team. A larger and more skilled team will likely be able to complete tasks faster than a smaller and less skilled team.
